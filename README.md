# Handwritten Text Recognition using Deep-learning-RNN

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a Handwritten Text Recognition system using deep learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The project was implemented on Google Colaboratory, a data analysis and machine learning application.

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning (RNN)
- Google Colaboratory

## Project Structure
The project includes the following components:
- Python files for training, testing, and evaluation
- Dataset (e.g., IAM Dataset)
- Jupyter/Colab notebooks

## Getting Started
To run the project, follow these general steps:
1. Open Google Colab in your web browser and sign in with your Google account.
2. Create a new Colab notebook and import the necessary libraries and packages.
3. Upload the Python files and dataset required for the project.
4. Run the Python files by executing the necessary commands in the Colab notebook.
5. Save and download the results of the project.
